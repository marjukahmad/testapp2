		 <h3> The Art of War Quotes </h3>
		 
		 
<p> “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” </p> 

<p> “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” </p>

<p>  “All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.” </p>
